## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- Media Queries

### What I learned

With this project I was able to practice the use of flex to organize the elements of a section of the document in a simple and responsive way.


### Continued development

I realize when carrying out this type of project that I must continue studying a lot, reinforce my notions about flex, grid and everything that is necessary to achieve more professional structures. And, above all, that I need to improve my English.
